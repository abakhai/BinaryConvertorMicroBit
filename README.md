# BinaryConverterMicroBit

## For use with the BBC MicroBit

## A Python script that takes an 8 bit binary input from the 2 buttons on the BBC Microbit (A as 0, B as 1) to create an 8bit binary string, converts this to a decimal number. Then displays the decimal number scrolling on the screen. It's super cool!
